## Exams

Exams are, as you can guess, exams. They take place for 4 hours, the Fridays from 4PM to 8PM. You are free to finish whenever you want. <br><br>
During the exam, you are alone on the computer, you cannot use the internet, your previous projects nor speak with the others. You can have a blank paper and a pen to take notes. <br><br>
Even though you can use whatever text editor/IDE you want on the projects, in exam, you can only use the Terminal, Vim, Emacs & Nano, so be sure to remember everything you think will be useful, or at least know where to search.

### Exam 00

First exam at the end of the first week. Should be relatively easy and revolves mainly around the `write` function in C and the notions in [C00](#c-00) and [C01](#c-01). <br>
As I not enough prepared, I completely froze on the first exercise, it was really easy, just print a character with the `write` function, but I didn't know the name of the library to include (`unistd.h`), and after two hours of tries and labor, I finally abandonned, that resulted in this grade (yes it's considered as a success anyway for whatever reason): <br>

## Rushs

Rushs are projects in randomly generated groups, where you need to work in cooperation to complete your subject. <br><br>
There will be only one correction, not by other pisciners but by members of the staff, and every member of the group should know how to explain the program clearly, as it will be graded "in particular on the group's least solid explanations".
